## Own and share professional qualification in trustable way.

CryptoCert is a proof of concept project of migrating professional certificates into the digital traceable blockchain.

CryptoCert is a cryptographically secure and verifiable identity management solution backed by Blockchain technology. We believe identity management can be easy to use and highly secure. This allows us to advance into a trustable identity future.

This solution is built based on blockchain technology, allowing job seekers and employers to verify job seekers' academic and professional qualifications. The certificate issuer will cryptographically sign the certificates, tamper-proof, and shareable by issuing the academic and professional certificates via blockchain.
