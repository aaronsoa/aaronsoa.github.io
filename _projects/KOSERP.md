## ERP system for insurance and accounting company

KOS system is an ERP system rebuild project that I have done for a Hong Kong SME. Since the client found that the old system was slow and obsolete, they decided to reach for my team to rebuild the system from the ground up.

The client also requests to preserve and migrate all the data, including database and media files, to the new system.

## My Role

- Business Negotiation
- UI Design
- User requirement gathering

## Tech Stack

Backend: Ruby on Rails

Frontend: React

Styling: Bootstrap

## Product

After we have a preliminary discussion with the client, I decided to spend more time gathering the user requirements. 

The average age of the client's employees was high, and they have interacted with the old system for almost ten years. I have conducted serval interviews with different employees on their thoughts about the old system.

I decide to design the user interaction with a similar layout as the old one but improve the system's interaction.
