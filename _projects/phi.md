# First Chapter of my startup journey
## We build solution for students

PhiCard is where I start my entrepreneurship journey. I cofounded Phi Info (Hong Kong) Limited back when I was doing my  year 3 study when I was an undergrad. We build product that evolve around student’s life, as we believe we will have a better grasp of the user requirement since we are all student.

## My Role
I am responsible for the product design, coding and business pitching. 

## Key Learning
Digital Marketing
First Taste of Management
Product Design - Design Thinking
Survey


## Product - Virtual Orientation for University Student (We born too early)

The first product that we have built is a virtual platform for new students to meet-up when each others. We were trying to create a virtual orientation camp experience. (Now would be a good time for this product after COVID.)

Users will need to register with their student email for validating their student identity. Then they would simply select the program they are going to study and will be put into the same room with all the other users. The production also use Facebook Login SDK to improve the user experience where they could opt in for login.

## Pivot - Student Discount platform

After the orientation season, we failed to retent users as we did not provide much value other than allow the users to connect. They get connected through our product then move back to social media network on further interaction.

We decided to pivot from being a social entrance tool to discount platform which exclusive available for students. We believe building value from student stage would give edges to brands in building long term loyalty relationship.
