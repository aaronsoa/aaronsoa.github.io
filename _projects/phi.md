# First Chapter of my startup journey
## We build solutions for students

PhiCard is where I start my entrepreneurship journey. I co-founded Phi Info (Hong Kong) Limited when I was doing my year 3 study when I was an undergrad. We build products that evolve around students' lives, as we believe we will have a better grasp of the user requirement since we are all students.

## My Role

- Product Design
- Product Implementation
- Business Pitching
- Business Negotiation

## Product - Virtual Orientation for University Student (We born too early)

The first product that we have built is a virtual platform for new students to meet up. We were trying to create a virtual orientation camp experience. (Now would be a good time for this product after COVID.)

Users will need to register with their student email to validate their student identity. Then they would select the program they are going to study and be put into the same room with all the other users. The production also uses Facebook Login SDK to improve the user experience where they could opt-in for login.

## Pivot - Student Discount platform

After the orientation season, we failed to retent users as we did not provide much value other than allowing the users to connect. They get connected through our product then move back to social media networks for further interaction.

We decided to pivot from being a social entrance tool to a discount platform exclusive to students. We believe building value from the student stage would give edges to brands in building long-term loyalty relationships.
