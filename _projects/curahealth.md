## Health should be available for everyone.

Cura Health is a startup with a bold aim: Create a painless experience to understand their health and provide a one-stop solution. 

Cura Health was founded on the foundation of bringing personalized vitamins for everyone and every day. Every one of us is built differently. There is no one-off solution for everyone. Multivitamin is a good start, but we believe tailor-made is the real solution.

We have redesigned the whole consumption experience with vitamins. In the past, people hardly built the habit of consuming vitamins. Refilling the pillbox and selecting the right vitamins is always like climb over mountains. We redesign the experience to comply with the millennials' lifestyle and leverage social media to encourage consumption and viral promotion.

Cura Health offers a simple, affordable, and fully-tailored vitamin experience in dealing with nutrition imbalance. Cura Health's core value consists of sourcing, algorithm, and expert team.

## My Role

As part of the founding team and product manager, I worked with a small and agile product team to design and build the solution Cura. I started working in Cura from the starting point and begin building the product from scratch. 

I was also involved in the business operation with the business team for managing the digital marketing campaign, analytics, and business negotiation.


## Product - Smart suggestion system

The diagnosis system is intended to create a simple diagnosis solution for our potential customers. Upon completing the diagnosis process, the user would receive their supplement recommendation after they register for an account. Also, they will have access to health recommendations which are generated by health scores.

After further user research on the existing and new customers, I decided to create more assessments that focus on private area health. We also collaborated with media such as JDaily for acquisition.

## System Design

The system can be divided into four extensive modules: diagnosis, member center, payment gateway, and production management system.

### Diagnosis System

The diagnosis system's design is focused on iteration and health improvements.

The diagnosis system consists of three parts, the initial diagnosis, daily check-in, and follow-up diagnosis. The bigger idea is to implement data analysis and machine learning to further improve the suggestion's accuracy. The data sets could also provide a quick suggestion route by clustering the existing customers.

Daily check-ins are implemented in the form of a scan of a QR code on the package. It could increase user stickiness by daily interaction with our product and provide more insight into the users' dataset. If they have checked in more regularly, the dataset will tend to be more trustable.

We believe in iteration on health treatment. Your body and health situation will change over time, and so does your health treatment. Follow-up diagnosis is built on top of this idea. The follow-up diagnosis will happen bi-monthly, and the assessment is built around the effectiveness of the recipe we have provided.

### Member Center
Member Center is where users could make changes and review their current order. Users could also make changes to their account information, and it is also the home of the loyalty program.

#### Loyalty Program

To increase user stickiness and loyalty, we have created a loyalty program for our users. 

Users could receive rewards when they have done the following actions.

- Daily Check-in
- Complete the follow-up diagnosis
- Refer new customers
- Improvements in Health

The reward will be in the form of Cura Points. The user will also grant achievement badges whenever they receive their rewards.

#### Affiliate

In leveraging word of mouth on marketing, we have built an affiliate module that rewards the user if they have introduced a new customer to our service.

Users could share their affiliate links with their friends. Once their friend has purchased the product, they would see an update of Cura Points in their dashboard.

### Payment Gateway with Subscription - Customization

Stripe is the payment gateway provider, and we have done serval customization on top of it due to our business nature.

We allow the user to pause their subscription, change the delivery date, and offer multiple payment models.

### Production Management System

This business has adapted a fully automated manufacturing line, while a bridge system is needed to communicate between the machine and our system.

We have set up an API endpoint at the PMS, and the e-commerce system will call it once Stripe confirms the payment.

Since we also provide manufacturing service for other business, the system also supports Excel import for handling the orders.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Next.js

Backend: Django - REST Framework

DevOps: Docker GitLab CI/CD

## Management

The company's management is built on top of agile management with scrum. The aim is to let the team focus on a two-week sprint and me as the product owner to figure out the macro picture.

I was involved in the daily scrum meeting and hosted the bi-weekly sprint meeting for both the business operations team and the development team on day-to-day activities.

### International Interns
During the 2020's summer, we have boarded serval International interns for the development team from different places in the world, including Indian, Indonesia, and Korea.

The project also received an acquisition offer from Supplement Company in the same industry in 2020.
