## Health should be available for everyone.

Cura Health is a startup with bold aim: Create a pain less experience to understand their health and provide a one stop solution. 

Cura Health was founded on the foundation of bringing personalized vitamins for everyone and every day. Every one of us is built differently. There is no one-off solution for everyone. Multivitamin is a good start, but we believe tailor made is the real solution.

We have redesigned the whole consumption experience with vitamins. In the past, people hardly built the habit of consuming vitamins. Refilling the pillbox and selection of the right vitamins is always like climb over mountains. We redesign the experience in complying with the millennials lifestyle and leverage the social media on both encourage consumption and viral promotion.

Cura Health offers a simple, affordable and fully-tailored vitamin experience in dealing with nutrition imbalance. CuraBox’s core value consists of sourcing, algorithm, and expert team.

## My Role

As part of the founding team and product manager, I worked with a small and agile product team to design and build the solution Cura. I started working in Cura from the starting point and start building product from scratch. 

I also involved in business operation with business team for managing the digital marketing campaign, analytics and business negotiation.


## Product - Smart suggestion system

The diagnosis system is intended to create a simple diagnosis solution to our potential customers. Upon completion of the diagnosis process, the user would receive their supplement recommendation after they register for an account. Also, they will have access to health recommendation which is generated by health score.
